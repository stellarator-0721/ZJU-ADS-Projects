Shortest Path Algorithm Test Framework
======================================

Quick Start
-----------
1. Compile all programs:
   mingw32-make

2. Generate query files (including guaranteed-path queries):
   mingw32-make generate_queries

3. Run tests:
   mingw32-make test_quick      (Recommended - tests 10 queries with guaranteed paths)
   or
   mingw32-make test_random
   or
   mingw32-make test_file

Compilation Targets
-------------------
mingw32-make              - Build main program and query generator
mingw32-make all          - Build all programs
mingw32-make debug        - Build debug version with debug symbols
mingw32-make release      - Build optimized release version
mingw32-make clean        - Clean build files
mingw32-make clean_all    - Clean all generated files including queries
mingw32-make help         - Show all available targets

Test Modes
----------
The program supports three test modes:

1. FILE MODE (test_file)
   Usage: dijkstra_test.exe <graph_file> file <queries_folder> [query_file] [detailed_count] [verify]
   Examples:
     .\bin\dijkstra_test.exe data\USA-road-d.USA.gr file Queries
     .\bin\dijkstra_test.exe data\USA-road-d.USA.gr file Queries normal_queries_1000.txt
     .\bin\dijkstra_test.exe data\USA-road-d.USA.gr file Queries normal_queries_1000.txt 5 1

2. RANDOM MODE (test_random)
   Usage: dijkstra_test.exe <graph_file> random [query_count] [detailed_count] [verify]
   Examples:
     .\bin\dijkstra_test.exe data\USA-road-d.USA.gr random 100
     .\bin\dijkstra_test.exe data\USA-road-d.USA.gr random 100 10 1
     .\bin\dijkstra_test.exe data\USA-road-d.USA.gr random 50

3. QUICK MODE (test_quick) - RECOMMENDED
   Usage: dijkstra_test.exe <graph_file> quick <queries_folder> [query_file] [max_queries]
   Examples:
     .\bin\dijkstra_test.exe data\USA-road-d.USA.gr quick Queries
     .\bin\dijkstra_test.exe data\USA-road-d.USA.gr quick Queries small_test_queries_10.txt 5

Parameter Explanation
---------------------
<graph_file>        - Path to graph data file (e.g., data\USA-road-d.USA.gr)
<queries_folder>    - Directory containing query files
<query_file>        - Specific query file to test
<query_count>       - Number of random queries to generate (default: 100)
<detailed_count>    - Number of detailed results to display (default: 5-10)
<verify>            - Verify result consistency (1=yes, 0=no, default: 1)
<max_queries>       - Maximum queries for quick test (default: 5)

Query Files Generation
----------------------
mingw32-make generate_queries
This will create various test query files in the Queries/ directory:
- small_test_queries_10.txt       (10 queries with guaranteed paths - RECOMMENDED)
- normal_queries_1000.txt         (1000 queries)
- large_scale_queries_10000.txt   (10000 queries)
- complete_graph_queries_100.txt  (100 queries)
- edge_case_queries.txt           (Special case queries)
- single_node_queries.txt         (Single node tests)
- empty_queries.txt               (Empty test file)

NEW: small_test_queries_10.txt Features
---------------------------------------
- Contains exactly 10 query pairs
- All queries guaranteed to have existing paths
- Generated from nodes with outgoing edges
- Perfect for quick performance testing
- Avoids unreachable queries that waste time

Performance Features
--------------------
- Timeout protection (10 seconds per query)
- Memory management
- Progress reporting
- Result consistency verification
- Automatic handling of unreachable nodes
- Performance ratio calculation (Pairing vs Fibonacci)

Recommended Usage for Large Graphs
----------------------------------
For graphs with millions of nodes (like USA-road-d.USA.gr):

1. Start with quick mode (tests guaranteed-path queries):
   mingw32-make test_quick

2. For more extensive testing, use random mode:
   mingw32-make test_random

3. For detailed analysis with specific queries, use file mode:
   .\bin\dijkstra_test.exe data\USA-road-d.USA.gr file Queries small_test_queries_10.txt

├── src/                    Source code
├── include/                Header files
├── build/                  Object files (auto-generated)

└── Makefile

Notes
-----
- Ensure graph data file exists in data\USA-road-d.USA.gr
- small_test_queries_10.txt now guarantees all queries have paths
- Each query timeout is set to 10 seconds to prevent hanging
- Program automatically skips invalid nodes and handles errors
- For best results, use the new small_test_queries_10.txt for quick testing
